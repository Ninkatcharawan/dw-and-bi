1. Importing Libraries
import glob import json import os from typing import List from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
	•	This block imports necessary libraries:
	•	glob: For file path manipulation and file listing.
	•	json: For JSON data handling.
	•	os: For file system operations.
	•	List from typing: For type hinting.
	•	Cluster from cassandra.cluster: For connecting to the Cassandra cluster.
2. Query Definitions
table_drop = "DROP TABLE events" table_create = """ CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events ( id text, type text, public boolean, PRIMARY KEY ( id, type ) ) """
	•	These are queries for dropping and creating the events table in Cassandra.
	•	The table has columns id, type, and public, with a composite primary key on id and type.
3. Functions for Table Management
def drop_tables(session): ... def create_tables(session): ...
	•	These functions handle dropping and creating tables, respectively.
	•	They execute the defined queries (table_drop and table_create) using the provided Cassandra session.
4. Data Processing Functions
def get_files(filepath: str) -> List[str]: ... def process(session, filepath): ...
	•	get_files(filepath) lists all JSON files in a directory specified by filepath.
	•	process(session, filepath) reads each JSON file, extracts data, and potentially inserts it into the Cassandra table.
5. Sample Data Insertion Function
def insert_sample_data(session): ...
	•	This function inserts sample data into the events table. It's currently hardcoded but can be modified to insert dynamic data.
6. Main Function
def main(): ...
	•	Establishes a connection to the Cassandra cluster and keyspace.
	•	Creates the keyspace if it doesn't exist and sets the keyspace to github_events.
	•	Calls functions to drop and create the events table.
	•	Optionally, it inserts sample data or performs data processing.
	•	Executes a select query to retrieve data from the events table and prints the results.
7. Execution
if __name__ == "__main__": main()
	•	This block ensures that the main() function is executed when the script is run directly.
